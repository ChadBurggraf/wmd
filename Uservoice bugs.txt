Opera post preview bug 

I can't seem to get to the cause of this bug, so here is the complete post:

<quote> 
Here's an idea: - Just before you create the alert window, stop the DragEvent 
....event.stopImmediatePropagation(); 
store the event so we can resume if the user clicks the Yes button 
....queuedEvent = event as DragEvent; 
show the alert window 
if the user clicks the yes button, resume the queued event 
....dispatchEvent(queuedEvent); 
</quote>

(dots are spaces) 
The problem here is that only the first indented piece of text is converted to code and has syntax highlighting. The other 2 are just indented, but no formatting applied to them.

I'm using Opera 9.61, XP SP3.
